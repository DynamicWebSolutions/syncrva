DESCRIPTION:Virginia Innovators Network is a not for profit\, educational o
 rganization. We exist to support innovative Virginians who are pursuing br
 inging their unique products and services to market. There is NO CHARGE to
  attend VINE monthly meetings --&nbsp\;Thank you to our generous sponsors 
 who make the pizza\, water\, &amp\; beer possible.\nOur primary approach t
 o providing this support is through membership meetings. These meetings se
 rve two purposes: networking and education. Aspiring entrepreneurs have th
 e ability to meet inventors and entrepreneurs who have successfully launch
 ed unique goods and services or professionals with subject matter expertis
 e that is pertinent to launching of these products and services. The speak
 ers at the meetings have direct expertise in one or more of the areas rela
 ted to bringing ideas to market.\n&gt\;&gt\;&gt\; For more details on upco

  our website contains references and information to help the innovator res
 earch and make appropriate contacts with subject matter experts.\nVINE gen
 erally meets on the 4th Monday of every month. Our meetings start with gen
 eral networking and dinner (pizza) at 5:30\, followed by a brief VINE busi
 ness meeting from 6:00 to 6:15. Typically\, our speakers will present from
  6:15 to 7:30. Following the presentation\, there is time allowed for indi
 vidual questions and/or additional networking.\nVINE attracts top regional
